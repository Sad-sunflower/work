</div>

#### 3. Advanced Properties

`Force Page Break`: Control whether the element is forced to display alone on the page.<br/>
`Drag Direction`: Set the direction in which the element can be dragged.<br/>

#### 4. Notes

4.1 HTML elements currently do not support pagination and can only be displayed on a single page. When the content of an HTML element is too long and overlaps other elements, you can set the fixed height in the style properties. This way, the overflow content will be hidden and will not overlap other elements.

4.2 If the HTML element is set with a field name and no data is retrieved, the preview will be empty.
