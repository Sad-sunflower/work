### Multi-Table Printing

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ The multi-table printing feature allows users to design and print reports with multiple tables, combining different data sources in a single report. Using the report designer, users can easily drag, copy, and adjust tables and assign different datasource fields to meet various printing needs.

#### **Example Explanation:**
Suppose you work in the finance department of an e-commerce company and need to print order details and invoices for each customer. Traditionally, you might need to print orders and invoices separately, but with the multi-table printing feature, you can display both order and invoice information in a single report. This feature is designed for such needs.

#### **1. Open the Designer**

> Open the designer via the eDocument DX Tab's Quick Start or New Template Data options.

#### **2. Select or Create a Template**

> In the Template Sample, select a template that already contains tables or create a new blank template.

#### **3. Clone and Adjust Tables**

> Select the table and use the toolbar buttons at the top to clone a new table.

#### **4. Modify Table Column Properties**

> Modify the field properties of the two tables separately to ensure they correspond to different datasource fields, so that different data is displayed during printing.

#### **8. Preview Print Settings**

> Refer to steps 1-3 in [Document Preview and Printing](ad-print.md#adprint-step1) to configure preview and printing functions.

#### **9. Select Data**

> After completing the preview print settings, select the Salesforce Object you want to print data from (which should be consistent with the Object in the Data Source Config), and select a record to see how it is displayed in the template.
