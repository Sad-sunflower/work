### Code Generation AI Assistant

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Implementing advanced functions and complex logic often requires a significant amount of time and effort. To improve development efficiency, we have introduced the Code Generation AI Assistant. This AI assistant can automatically generate the corresponding code based on the requirements provided by the user, helping you quickly complete your design tasks.

#### **Features of the Code Generation AI Assistant**
Requirement Analysis: Accurately understand the user's input description, including functional requirements, input and output formats, etc.<br/>
Code Generation: Generate the corresponding advanced function code snippets based on the user's input description.<br/>

#### **2. How to use the Code Generation AI Assistant?**

> 2.1 Click on any advanced function input box to open the AI Assistant window. Here, we take the bottom aggregation Format Function in a table column as an example.

> 2.2 Users can describe their requirements to the AI Assistant using natural language or a specific input format. For example:
```
- Display "Total Quantity:" + {aggregate value}. Aggregate value: Sum the values in the column, add comma separators for thousands, and do not display decimals. [html style: centered, light blue background, red font.]
- Table fields: productName(Product Name), quantity(Quantity), unitPrice(Unit Price), amount(Amount), month(Month)
```
