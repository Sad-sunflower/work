### Rich Text Content Printing

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ The rich text content printing feature allows you to easily embed rich text content into your print data when designing reports, automatically displaying it in HTML format during print preview. By binding HTML code to the rich text box, the system can automatically parse and display the formats included in the code, such as hyperlinks, italics, colors, etc. When handling HTML data, be sure to replace all double quotes with single quotes or use the placeholder &amp;quot; to avoid parsing conflicts.

#### **Example Explanation:**
Suppose you are designing a template for orders that needs to display order details, including order number, customer information, shipping address, and product list. The product description is crucial, involving bold, italics, colors, and embedded hyperlinks to product pages. Using the rich text content printing feature, you can directly embed HTML-formatted product descriptions into the template, ensuring the best display effect in the print preview. This way, customers can intuitively understand product details and click links to see more information when they receive the printed order.
