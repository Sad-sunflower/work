### Shopping Receipt

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Shopping receipts play a crucial role in the retail industry. When customers purchase goods in a store, the receipt provides detailed purchase information, including a list of items, prices, purchase date, and more. This not only helps customers verify their purchases but also facilitates subsequent return or exchange services.
